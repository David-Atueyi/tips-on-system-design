# SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE

THE SUMMARIZATION OF A 10 PAGE SOFTWARE DESIGN AND DESIGN PATTERN BY ArjanCodes AS REQUESTED BY OsMAXIN 

Before i begin the summary on what a system design is, let us first take a step back and learn what a system design is.

So what is a system design? It is the process of planning a software system, specifying its architecture, components, and data structures to meet specific requirements. it is basically the most important part in system development, essential for ensuring the final result aligns with desired functionality, performance, and reliability standards.

As you can see from the definition that system design is basically the planning stage or phase of a software system, So now let me give you some key points to follow when planning yours as stated by the creator of the PDF ArjanCodes.

ABOUT : when planning you need to fully understand what the software application would be doing, that is the problem which the software application would be solving and also you need to consider and understand the users whose problems would be solved by your software application. when in this phase you would discover that there is need for you to take your time to think because trust me when i say a well sort out plan would make implementation very easy and effective. so when in this stage try to think like the user.

USER INTERFACE : when planning you need to put your self in the user's shoes, this means that you should see your self not as a developer but as a user in order to meet the user's requirement ,there by making a user friendly and easy to use interface, if you can achieve this you would be able to make the user fall in love with your software application.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION : A technical specification is like a detailed guidebook for making software. It tells you exactly what's needed, from materials to dimensions to build the final product. It's crucial to understand these specifics to ensure the software application turns out just right.

TESTING AND SECURITY : Testing is like searching for mistakes in your code to make it better and more dependable. To write high-quality code, think like a tester, assume any code can cause issues. This mindset helps you naturally structure your code to handle potential problems. Design your code elements to guide users smoothly through the normal process, minimizing the chances of errors.

DEPLOYMENT : Before launching your software application, you should check if there are any big changes needed in how the software is set up or managed. you also need to ask if there are any special scripts to move existing data smoothly. These questions help prevent problems when putting the software into action.

PLANNING : Good planning means figuring out the main things that could go wrong, thinking about different ways to handle problems, deciding what parts are really necessary versus just nice to have, and doing the project in smaller steps. When you break the project into smaller parts, focus on important tasks, and keep checking how things are going, it makes the software development process more organized. This way, you can handle unexpected issues and stay on track with the main goals.

BROADER CONTEXT : 
It's important to understand what the current design can't do and think about possible improvements for the future. Also, being open to big, innovative ideas can bring unexpected and valuable insights during development. This open-minded approach boosts creativity and makes the software application even more valuable.
